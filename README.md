# SCAPA-UCB_Paper
This is a repo containing all code needed to reproduce simulation studies in the SCAPA-UCB paper.

The code for the different components of the algorithm can be found in the /code folder. This folder also contains "main.R" - this is the file that will
source the SCAPA-UCB code and then run each of the simulation studies found in the paper.

The results of "main.R" reproduce each of the tables and figures presented in the Numerical Results section of the SCAPA-UCB manuscript.
