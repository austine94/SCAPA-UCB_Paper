# SCAPA-UCB Paper
This is a repo containing all code needed to reproduce simulation studies in the SCAPA-UCB paper.

The code for the different components of the algorithm can be found in the /code folder. Several implementations of SCAPA-UCB are provided here, matching the simulations performed in the paper.

In order to run the code the package ScapaAnomaly will need to be installed using the tar.gz file.

The code folder also contains "main.R" - this is the file that will source the SCAPA-UCB code and then run each of the simulation studies. The results of "main.R" reproduce each of the tables and figures presented in the Numerical Results section of the SCAPA-UCB manuscript.
